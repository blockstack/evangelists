# Blockstack Evangelists

This repo is a collection of presentations and explainers for anyone presenting about Blockstack to technical audiences, as well as non-technical audiences. Also included are presentations that have been given at various conferences and events.

### Adding your slide deck

If you have been to an event lately, or are going to be at an event soon, we would love to see your slides and share that information so others can use it too!

To add your slide deck please open a Pull Request against the repository and add your your presentation with the file name format `{presentation_name}-{github_username}.pptx` (or other format) to the `/community-slides` folder. Also add a line to the [`README.md`](/community-slides/README.md) in that folder with the following format:

```md
- [{presentation_name}](/community-slides/{file_name}) - @{github_username} ({month} {year})

Example

- [Blockstack For Beginners](/community-slides/blockstack4beginners-dhealy05.pptx) - @dhealy-5 (December 2017)
```
